## Installation

To install this, clone the repository git clone https://github.com/avilwock/ai-coding-assistant.git

cd into JS_Library

run npm install

Create an .env file in the root directory:

OPENAI_API_KEY = your_api_key_here

node server.js

access via http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Usage

Open the app in your browser
Enter a JavaScript or coding-related question
The AI will return a formatted answer

If a non-coding question is asked, the assistant is designed not to respond.

## Security Notes
.env is ignored via .gitignore
API keys are never committed
Uses Express JSON middleware

## Future Improvements

Strict server-side validation for coding-only questions
Streaming responses
Better formatting for code blocks
Convert to different app versions
Deployment to a live hosting platform
